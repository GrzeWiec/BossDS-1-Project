# BossDS-1-Project

My first steps in the world of analog electronics:
- learning the principle of operation of basic electronic components,
- creating the first schematic and PCB in KiCad,
- work based on the famous Boss DS-1 guitar effect,
- getting basic knowledge about the approach to working with an audio signal in electronics.

I created the effect diagram based on the diagram found on the website: https://www.electrosmash.com/boss-ds1-analysis.
